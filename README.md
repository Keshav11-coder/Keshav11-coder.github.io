> welcome to my github pages site, here I store all my front end made for codettes bootcamp, hackathons and side projects

## bootcamp22 ðŸ¤–
### chatapp ðŸ’¬
this was part of codettes bootcamp2022, we had to makea  chatapp with MQTT (hiveMQ), html css and javascript. all code is there!

### chatapp v4
this was the first version of the chatapp, its called v4 because the previous versions were only front end. this does not work though

> note that the chatapp can only work when you set the site settings to "allow insecure content"

### NodeJS server connecting to chatapp ðŸš€
we were connecting NodeJS to our chatapp, so we can do other cool stuff with it.

> this runs on localhost though
